Dear Amir

Thank you for adding MySQL to the firewall.

I'm tryng to access the MySQL server but it's still not working:

```
garcm0b@KW20207:~$ mysql -h 10.127.6.29 -u irts -p test_irts
Enter password:
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on '10.127.6.29:3306' (110)
garcm0b@KW20207:~$
```

This means the client can't access the server. The connection time out:

```
connect(4, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(3306), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.127.6.29")}, 16) = -1 ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out)
shutdown(4, SHUT_RDWR)                  = -1 ENOTCONN (Transport endpoint is not connected)
```

If I test from a machine (lthlibtest/10.127.4.56) inside the datacenter it works:

```
a-garcm0b@lthlibtest:~$ mysql -h 10.127.6.29 -u irts -p test_irts
Enter password:
(...)
Your MySQL connection id is 185962
Server version: 8.0.43-0ubuntu0.22.04.2 (Ubuntu)
```

I opened the port 3306 on our workstation

```
garcm0b@KW20207:/data/ETD_rag/markdown$ sudo ufw status verbose

Can you double check the firewall is allowing traffic from the workstation to the `lthlibdb`? Or if you have another suggestion, let me know.
